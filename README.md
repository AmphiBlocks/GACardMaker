Grand Archive Custom Card Maker

Hi GA fans!

This tool allows you to create your own custom GA cards.

It's still pretty rough, so I'm releasing it through github for feedback and testing. It does do its job though.

Installation instructions:
- download the files and put them in a directory
- open index.html in your browser

Let me know of any issues
